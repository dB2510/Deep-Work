Title: Deep Work is Valuable
From: [[Introduction]]

My key takeways:

*	An increasing number of people will lose in this new economy as their skill becomes automatable or easily outsourced, there are others who will not only survive but thrive in this new economy.
*	Deep work becomes more valuable for those who want to become indispensable.
*	There are three will have particular advantage in this new economy: 
	*	Those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines. By the way, machines are getting intelligent day by day so you also have to update yourself.
	*	Those who are best at what they do. (Be so good they can't ignore you)
	*	Those with access to capital. (Angel Investors or Venture Capitals).
*	There are 2 main ingredients for thriving in this new economy:
	*	The ability to quickly master hard things.
	*	The ability to produce at an elite level in terms of both quality and speed.
*	The 2 core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work.
*	What is deliberate practice?
	*	Your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you're trying to improve or an idea you're trying to master.
	*	You receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it's most productive.
*	**Myelin** - a layer of fatty tissue that grows around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows the cells to fire faster and cleaner.
	*	This new science of performance argues that you get better at a skill as you develop more myelin around the relevant neurons, allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlessly and effectively.
	*	The reason, therefore, why it's important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination.
*	"Law of Productivity":
	*	High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) X (Intensity of Focus)

*	**Attention Residue**: When you switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn't immediately follow, a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task.
