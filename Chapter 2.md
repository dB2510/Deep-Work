Title: Deep Work is Rare
From: [[Chapter 1]] and [[Introduction]]

My key takeways:

* **The Principle of Least Resistance**: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.
* **Busyness as Proxy for Productivity**: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.
* **Technopoly**: Culture where people think that if it's high tech, they began to assume its good without measuring pros and cons of it.
