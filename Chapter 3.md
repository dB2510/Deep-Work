Title: Deep Work is Meaningful
From: [[Chapter 2]] and [[Introduction]]

My key takeaways;
* The satisfactions of manifesting oneself concretely in the world through manual competence have been known to make a man quiet and easy
* The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.
* The task of a craftman is not to generate meaning, but rather to cultivate in himself the skill of discerning the meanings that are already there.
* You don't need a rarified job, you need instead a rarified approach to your work.
